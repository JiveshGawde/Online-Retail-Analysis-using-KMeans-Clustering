# Online-Retail-Analysis-using-KMeans-Clustering
Online Retail Analysis using KMeans Clustering was done while using real retail data from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii). The entire analysis in this was a direct copy from tutorial session by YouTuber 'TrendDoesMath' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afPJeQuVeuY) an excellent guide for data science and machine learning. 
Analysis on Retail Data is done for understanding relationship between monetary value, frequency and recency.
In this analysis, libraries like pandas, matplotlib, plotly and scikit learn are used.
This session is great for understanding how to use regex, boxplots, violin plots and 3D plots for analysis.
